    apiKey: process.env.GPTP_API_KEY,
    userId: getCurrentUserId(),
    gameId: 'snake-game'
};

// Error handling
try {
    const session = await gptpClient.startGameSession(gameConfig.gameId);
    console.log('Game session started:', session.sessionId);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start game session:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Unable to start game. Please try again.');
}
```

```python
# Python standards
class GameSessionManager:
    """Manages game sessions and scoring."""
    
    def __init__(self, user_id: str, game_id: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.game_id = game_id
        self.session_id = None
    
    def start_session(self) -> GameSession:
        """Start a new game session."""
        try:
            session = create_game_session(self.user_id, self.game_id)
            self.session_id = session.id
            return session
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to start session: {e}")
            raise GameSessionError("Unable to start game session")
```

        client = new GPTPClient('test-api-key', 'test-user-id');
    });
    
    test('should start game session successfully', async () => {
        const mockResponse = { sessionId: 'test-session-id' };
        fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({
            ok: true,
            json: async () => mockResponse
        });
